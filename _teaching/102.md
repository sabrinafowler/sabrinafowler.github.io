Spring 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024

For the 2023-2024 academic year, I was the Associate Convener for Math 102 - College Trigonometry at UNL. I worked together with the faculty convener to maintain continuity across all sections of the course, as well as provide support for graduate student instructors.
