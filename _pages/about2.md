I am currently a PhD candidate in my fourth year in the Mathematics department at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am advised by Elo√≠sa Grifo and I am interested in commutative algebra and its applications. I am from St. Louis, Missouri, and I received my BS in Applied Math and MS in Mathematics from Missouri State University. I enjoy crocheting, reading, and spending time with my dog, Lulu.

One of my main goals in life is to find a way to use my mathematical expertise to make the world a better place. I would love to contribute to the fight against climate change, and I am also passionate about preserving human rights, including the right to vote. Although commutative algebra is not traditionally considered "applied math", I firmly believe that my skills as a mathematician can be applied to solving all sorts of problems.

I was previously known as Sabrina Klement.
