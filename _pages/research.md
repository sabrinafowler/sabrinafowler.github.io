### Research Interests
I have been working on developing my skills with various commutative algebra and algebraic geometry tools such as symbolic powers of ideals, Gröbner bases, and sheaf theory. I hope to use these tools to solve problems in areas such as mathematical neuroscience and topological data analysis.

My current research questions include
> What can be learned about a neural code by computing the multigraded Betti numbers of the corresponding polarized neural ideal?

> How can we connect neural ideals to neural network architectures?
