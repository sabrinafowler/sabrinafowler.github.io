## Research Interests

My research currently focuses on __neural ideals__. A neural ideal is a mathematical objects which encodes neural firing patterns corresponding to a certain configuration of a stimulus space. My current research questions include:

> What can be learned about a neural code by computing the multigraded Betti numbers of the corresponding polarized neural ideal?

> It is possible to construct a neural ideal based on a deep learning (neural network) model. Which properties of this ideal will give us insight into the model?
