## Research Interests

My research currently focuses on __neural ideals__. A neural ideal is a mathematical objects which encodes neural firing patterns corresponding to a certain configuration of a stimulus space. My current research questions include:

> What can be learned about a neural code by computing the multigraded Betti numbers of the corresponding polarized neural ideal?

> It is possible to construct a neural ideal based on a deep learning model. Which properties of this ideal will give us insight into the model?

## Seminars
I am currently regularly attending the following seminars at University of Nebraska-Lincoln
  * Commutative Algebra Seminar (CAS)
  * Commutative Algebra Reading Seminar (CARS)
  * Matemáticas
