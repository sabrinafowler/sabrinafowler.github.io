## Teaching Projects
For the 2023-2024 academic year, I was the Associate Convener for Math 102 - College Trigonometry at UNL. I worked together with the faculty convener to maintain continuity across all sections of the course, as well as provide support for graduate student instructors.

In summer 2023, I worked on a couple of curriculum development projects.

I worked on course materials for College Trigonometry, which primarily involved making changes to the Course Packet, which is a workbook for students that includes problems meant to be worked on in groups via active learning. This summer I added fill-in-the-blank style notes pages in addition to the problems, as well as making small changes to existing problems, and writing a few new problems. I also worked on making some small changes to existing WeBWorK problems, as well as writing new ones to go with the new Course Packet problems.

Another project I worked on was Curriculum Development and Instruction for the College of Engineering's Summer Bridge Program, a program to help incoming first-year undergraduate Engineering majors succeed in their math courses. The course I worked on was for students who were enrolling in College Algebra in the fall. I worked with a fellow graduate student to develop the curriculum, which consisted of identifying the most important sections and problems from UNL's Intermediate Algebra course to fit into the allotted timeframe. I was also the instructor for this course, which ran for two weeks.
