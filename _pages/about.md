I am a Mathematics PhD Candidate in my fifth year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, advised by [Eloísa Grifo](https://grifo.github.io). 

I am interested in mathematical neuroscience, with an eye towards applying these ideas to neural networks in machine learning.

For the Spring 2025 Semester, I was an RTG Trainee with [Commutative Algebra at Nebraska](https://nebraskacommalg.github.io). One of my responsibilities was to create a video on a mathematical topic I am knowledgeable about. I created the following video, _An Introduction to Gröbner Bases and their Applications_, which is a digital version of the talk I gave in UNL's Commutative Algebra Seminar as part of my Oral Comprehensive Exam. I am very proud of this video, and it has been well recieved on YouTube.
