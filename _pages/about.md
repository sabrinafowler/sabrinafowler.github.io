I am a Mathematics PhD Candidate in my fourth year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am advised by [Eloísa Grifo](https://grifo.github.io). For the Spring 2025 Semester, I am and RTG Trainee with [Commutative Algebra at Nebraska](https://nebraskacommalg.github.io). I am interested in symbolic powers of ideals, Gröbner bases, and sheaf theory. I am also interested in using these techniques to solve problems in mathematical neuroscience and topological data analysis.
